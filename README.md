## Summary 

In terms of starting a bike sharing company there are several metrics that should be focussed on: 

- Location
  A majority of bikes should be easily accessible, as well as housed at high traffic locations where they are more likely to be checked out and returned to. 
  
- Inventory 
  Bikes will need to be available during peak hours which are generally 5am-9am and 4pm-7pm. This is due to most of the population in the U.S having a traditional work schedule.
